#OFFICE NOTES

Office Notes provides an interactive platform to enhance the communication between Students and Professors at University & Schools.  

Student interaction with Professors always improves the education quality as it enhances feedback and gives room for academic growth. Finding a professor without a prior appointment is always difficult and consumes lot of time travelling across different blocks in the university. Student should wait for a longer time if professor is unavailable due to several reasons which in turn affects his/her academic progress and increase stress levels. 
We need a better communication system to handle these scenarioâ€™s and maximize the productive time of a student.
